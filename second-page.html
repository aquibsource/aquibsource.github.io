<h1>BLS Budget Guide</h1>
  <h4> Start with the first Insertion Order </h4>
  <p> Calculate the IO's per day budget by using this formula: (remaining budget/remaining days) 
      <break>Now, calculate the 10 day budget by doing this: (per day budget)*10  </p>
  <p> This is the IO's budget for 10 days of flight </p>

  <h4> Take the first line item </h4>
  <p><ul> <li> If the line item has no budget allocated, no need for this step </li> 
          <li> If the line item has daily budget allocated, then that is the per day budget. 
               So calculate the 10 days budget do this: (per day budget)*10 </li>
          <li> If the line item has some definite budget allocated, substract the already spent budget of this line item and then calculate the remaining budget.</li>
          <li> Next step is to calculate the per day budget by doing: (remainign budget/remaining days)</li>
          <li> Take out the 10 day budget by: (per day budget)*10 </li>
          <li> After you've finally got the LI's 10 day budget, note it down.
            
            <h5> Repeat the process for the rest of the Line items in the IO </h5>
  <li> After the budget for all the LIs are found, sum them up </li>
  <li> Compare this budget with the IO's 10 day budget and take the lower of the budgets from the IO and the total sum of LIs </li>
  
  <h5> Repeat the same process for all the other Insertion Orders if any! </h5> 
  <li> This can get painful. if there are a lot if IOs and LIs. Watch out this space for a tool that would make the process easy.
